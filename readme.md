# Heisenberg.js

## A project base for building modern JavaScript applications

Please note that current Heisenberg is under _very_ active development. Large changes may happen often until we hit V1.0.0.

### Features

* Not a framework, but a base project to help you structure your JavaScript code and files.
* Templating built in - Handlebars is included but feel free to change engines.
* Uses RequireJS for managing modules and dependencies.
* Included: jQuery, Underscore.js and Handlebars.
* A fully commented source to show you why it's doing what it's doing and how to build upon it's foundation.
* The JavaScript version of the HTML5 Boilerplate

### Getting Started

* Use our [npm module](https://github.com/Heisenbergjs/heisenberg-npm) to get started.
* `npm install -g heisenberg`
* `mkdir newproject && cd newproject`
* `heisenberg`
* `grunt server` and visit localhost:3000 to preview
* Job done!
